The following folder consists of the code for a protoype model of a subsation asset maintenance chatbot.
We can integrated open ai to accept user requests and give answer to general queries that the user has. 
This is just a prototype model and for our final project, we will implement our own database which will have details on multiple substation assets.
Our final chatbot will be able to answer specific user queries from the customer which will help the user to know more about their product and help them resolve issues.
