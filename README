The following folder consists of the code for a protoype model of a subsation asset maintenance chatbot.
We can integrated open ai to accept user requests and give answer to general queries that the user has. 
This is just a prototype model and for our final project, we will implement our own database which will have details on multiple substation assets.
Our final chatbot will be able to answer specific user queries and will finally be able to help the customer.
